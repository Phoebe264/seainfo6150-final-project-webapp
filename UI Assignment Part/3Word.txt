My website will be "Approachable", "Friendly" and "Warm". Because the homepage and navigation bar are stright-forward.
The main color for the website is light pink and purple, very warm and won't let viwers feel pressure. There are many pets' photos will make viewers feel friendly.
In every page, photos are taking most of the space, which can emphasize pets, viewers can easily track on the pet they are interested in.
